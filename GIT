> What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system (vcs)
Git is a tool that helps multiple people work on the same code project or documents by tracking and managing changes to the files.

> Why is Git Used?
1) Track Changes 
Keeps a full history of file changes.
you can see who changed what and when.
you can revert to older versions if something break.

2) Collaborate with Teams
Multiple people can work on the same project.
Each developer has their own local copy.
Prevents overwriting each other's work.

3) Version Control
Every stable version can be saved using commits
Each rollback to a previous working version

4) Branching and Merging
Create branches for new features, bug fixes and experiments
Merge changes safely into main code

5) Backup and Safety
Code is stored locally and remotely
No single point of failure

> What is GitHub?
cloud-based platorm that hosts Git repositories and helps developers store, manage, share and collaborate on code.
Wen based
Hosts and shares code

> Where GitHub is used?
1) Open source projects
2) Team software development
3) DevOps pipelines
4) Personal Portfolios

> What is VCS?
Everytime you make a change, whether it's adding a sentence to a document or altering a line of code, the VCS records and saves the outcome
VCS (Version Control System) is a tool that helps ou track, manage, and control changes made to files (especially source code) over time

> Why VCS?
1) Backup and Restore : Files are safe against accidental losses and mistakes
2) Collaboration : Multiple people can work on the same project simultaneously
3) Branching and Merging : Users can diverge from the main base of code, experiment and then bring changes back in line without losing work.
4) Tracking Changes : You can see specific changes made and by whom.

> mac : brew install git (install homebrew)
  linux : sudo yum install git
  windows : gitbash

> Configure Git with Username and Email
$ git config --global user.name "tanniiiyaa"
$ git config --global user.email natniya7@gmail.com
$ git config --list

> Repository 
A storage location for your project
It contains Files and Change history
Can be --- 
+ Local Repository : A local repository is the Git repository on your own computer.
Exists on your laptop/PC.
Created using $ git init.
works offline.

+ Remote Repository : A remote repository is a Git repository stored on a server (like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
Exists on the cloud/server.
Refers to a version of your project that resides on a network or a hosted repo on the internet
Used for Backup and Collaboration.
Accessed via internet
Common remote name : origin

> How Local & Remote Work Together?
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"   # local
$ git push origin main             # send to remote
$ git pull origin main             # get updates from remote

> Snapshot-Based Versioning
In Git, every commit is a snapshot of the entire project at that moment, not just a list of changed files.
Git saves how the project looks at that point in time.
When you commit: Git takes a snapshot of all tracked files
If a file didn’t change, Git: Reuses the previous snapshot (no extra space)
This makes Git fast and efficient.
Commit 1 → fileA, fileB
Commit 2 → fileA (changed), fileB (same)
Git stores:
New snapshot for fileA
Reuses old snapshot for fileB

> History Tracking
History tracking is Git’s ability to record and maintain a timeline of all changes made to a repository.
What Git Tracks

- For every commit, Git records:
Who made the change
When it was made
What was changed
Commit message
Unique commit ID (SHA)

- Commands used :
$ git log        # full history
$ git log --oneline
$ git blame file.txt
$ git show

> Git Architecture
Git internally works with 4 main areas
Working Directory → Staging Area → Local Repository → Remote Repository

1) Working Directory
The actual project folder on your system
Where files physically exists and where you write code, edit files and delete files
- File states in WD
+ Untracked : Git doesn’t know the file
+ Modified : File changed but not staged
+ Tracked : File already under Git

2) Staging Area
temporary holding place where you choose which changes will be included in the next commit.
With staging, you decide what to commit and you can create clean and meaningful commits
Lets you choose exactly what goes into a commit
$ git add .  (WD -> SA)
$ git restore --staged file.txt (remove from staging)
$ git status
$ git diff
$ git diff --staged
$ git add -p (partial staging / useful when one file has multiple changes and you want separate commits)

3) Local Repository (.git)
.git is a hidden folder inside your project which is Git's brain
inside .git, Git stores - commits, branches, history and snapshots

Edit File ----- Changes not saved
git add ------- Select what to save
git commit ------ Save Snapshot (stored inside .git)

4) Remote Repository
A copy of your local repository, stored on the internet

> git push 
before push : Commits exist only on your computer and nobody else can see them
$ git push origin main
after push : Your commits are copied to GitHub and team can pull the changes, review and deploy them

Edit file
   ↓
git add
   ↓
git commit   → Saved in .git (local repo)
   ↓
git push     → Copied to GitHub (remote repo)

Edit files
   ↓
Working Directory
   ↓ git add
Staging Area
   ↓ git commit
Local Repository (.git)
   ↓ git push
Remote Repository (GitHub)

$ git init              # new repo
$ git clone <url>       # existing repo
$ code app.js           # amke changes 
$ git status            # check the status
$ git add app.js or git add .     # Moves changes to Staging Area
$ git commit -m "Add login functionality"  # Creates a snapshot and Saves to Local Repository
$ git push origin main    # Sends commits to Remote Repository
$ git pull origin main    # get latest changes from others

ls - la : shows the hidden file that is .git (hidden file that is responsible foractivites, changes, commits, updates)

> Git Commit : command in git that captues a snapshot of the project's currently staged cahnges, creating a permanent record in the repo's history.

$ git diff  (shows the difference between the present and previous past files, Shows differences between versions)
$ git log   (shows commit history)

> To check pervious versions, we need commit ID, for that so use git log
then we use $ git show <commit id> : <file_name>

> $ git checkout <commit-id> : you are moving your project to an old commit to see how the code looked at that time.
 
> $ git checkout main : move from one branch to another
  $ git checkout dev
  $ git checkout -b branch-name  : create + switch
  $ git checkout -- file  : undo file changes

> Negative Cases
If we made any change by mistake and save it

1) Case1: To undo changes, get the last successful change 
$ git restore . or filename (. mean all files)

2) Case2: If we added the changes using git add then..
$ git restore --staged <file_path> # To unstage
$ git restore <file_path> # To discard changes in the working directory

3) Case3: Added changes to staging area (didn't commit) after this added more changes to file
//To get the staged changes
$ git restore --worktree index.html

4) Case4: How about if we did commit also wrong files
$ git reset --soft HEAD^ (uncommit and keep the changes)
$ git reset --hard HEAD^ (uncommit and discard the changes)

> Useful Log Options 
git log -p -2   (last two commit with diff) (patch)
git log --stat (summary of changes)
git log --pretty=oneline
git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s"  (h : commit hash / an :author name / ar : author date relative / s : subject)
git log -S function_name ( suppose to find V4 string)
git log --grep="fix bug"  (search commit msg)
git log --since="2024-01-01"
git log --until="2024-01-01"
git log --author="vexana"
git log --no-merges

> git remote -v (verbose : show full details)
Where is my code going when I push, and where does it come from when I pull?
view the remote repositories connected to your local Git repository.
output to this is origin  https://github.com/user/myrepo.git (fetch)
                  origin  https://github.com/user/myrepo.git (push)
- fetch : used when you download code -- Get updates FROM gitHub to my laptop
- push : used when you upload the code -- Send my commits FROM laptop to GitHub
- origin : default name of the remote
