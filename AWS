-- TRADITIONAL VS CLOUD COMPUTING --

- Understanding Traditional Infrastructure Challenges

Before the rise of cloud computing, businesses relied heavily on traditional infra to host their applications.
Setting up a simple website involved significant costs and complexities.

1) Server Purchase: You had to purchase a physical server costing around ₹50,000 or more.
                    The server needed a secure and cold environment, often requiring renting a dedicated space.

2) Maintenance Costs: Continuous power supply and cooling systems were essential.
                      You needed to hire IT professionals to manage the server, handle hardware failures (like hard disk or RAM issues), and perform regular maintenance.

3) Over or Underutilization: If you anticipated 10,000 users but only received 10, the investment in a high-capacity server was wasted.
                             Conversely, if the number of users exceeded expectations, the server would crash due to overload, resulting in downtime and a poor user experience.

4) Inflexibility: Scaling up or down based on demand was cumbersome, leading to either over-provisioning or under-provisioning.

Cloud Computing revolutionizes how infra is managed, offering a solution to all the challenges of traditional setups :


- Cloud Computing 
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics—over the internet (“the cloud”) on a pay-as-you-go basis, instead of owning and maintaining physical hardware.

1) On-Demand Resource Provisioning : With cloud computing, you pay only for the resources you use. Need a server for a day? No problem. The cloud provider charges you on an hourly or even per-second basis. This eliminates upfront costs and over-provisioning.

2) Scalability : Cloud services automatically scale based on your needs. For instance:
                 If your website receives 10 users today and 10 million tomorrow, the cloud can seamlessly add or reduce servers to handle the traffic.
                 During low-traffic periods, resources scale down, reducing costs.

3) No Maintenance Hassles : Cloud providers manage the physical infrastructure, so you don’t need to worry about hardware failures, power supply, or cooling systems. This allows you to focus entirely on developing and optimizing your application.

4) Global Accessibility : All your cloud resources are accessible over the internet, ensuring high availability and reliability for users worldwide.

- Everday Cloud Examples ?
1) Google Drive : Stores your files on the cloud
2) Gmail : Provides email services without needing to set up a personal mail server.
3) Netflix : Streams movies and shows via cloud-hosted platforms.

- Why Businesses Prefer Cloud Computing?
1) Cost Efficiency : You only pay for what you use. If you stop using a server, you can shut it down, and the billing stops immediately.
2) Scalability and Flexibility : Handle sudden spikes in traffic without any manual intervention or additional setup. Resources are allocated dynamically to match your application’s needs.
3) Focus on Core Goals :Since infrastructure management is handled by the cloud provider, businesses can focus on building robust applications and delivering excellent user experiences.


-- INTRODUCTION TO CLOUD SERVICES --
Cloud services have revolutionized how businesses manage and deploy their applications by offering flexibility, scalability, and cost efficiency.
three primary types of  cloud services: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service ( PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).

- What are Cloud Services?
Cloud services provide resources, tools, and services to businesses over the internet, eliminating the need for complex on-premises infrastructure. Understanding these services can help identify the right fit for your needs.

- Types of Cloud Services 

1) Infrastructure as s Service (IaaS)
IaaS provides businesses with essential IT infrastructure, including virtual machines, storage, and networking.

+ Key Features : The cloud provider offers hardware and virtualization, along with an operating system.
                 Users decide the type of operating system (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora) and are responsible for managing applications on top of it. 
+ Example Use Case : You’ve purchased a virtual server and chosen your preferred OS.
                     All software, configurations, and maintenance are your responsibility.
+ Examples : Amazon EC2
             Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines
             Google Compute Engine

2) Platform as a Service (PaaS)
PaaS provides a platform that allows developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

+ Key Features : The provider manages the OS, middleware, and runtime.
                 You focus solely on application development and data management.
+ Example Use Case : A database administrator leverages PaaS to create and configure a database platform, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, with built-in replication and security features.
                     Developers can directly interact with the database without managing hardware or OS configurations.
+ Examples : Amazon RDS
             Google App Engine
             Heroku

3) Software as a Service (SaaS)
SaaS delivers fully functional software applications over the internet. These applications are managed entirely by the service provider.

+ Key Features : No setup or maintenance is required on the user’s end.
                 The service provider handles infrastructure, application maintenance, and updates.
+ Example Use Case : Email services like Gmail or Microsoft Outlook allow businesses to create custom email addresses (e.g., tan@learning-ocean.com) without setting up mail servers.
+ Examples : Gmail
             Dropbox
             Salesforce

IaaS: Hardware and virtualization layers are provided, with users managing the OS and applications.
PaaS: Includes everything in IaaS, along with middleware and runtime. Users focus only on data and applications.
SaaS: All layers, from hardware to applications, are fully managed by the provider.

- How to Identify the Right Service for Your Needs?
When choosing a cloud service, consider the following:
1) What is this service managing on my behalf?
2) What responsibilities do I have?
3) Does it align with my project requirements?


-- TYPES OF CLOUD MODELS --
Cloud computing has transformed how businesses manage resources by offering flexible and scalable solutions. 
There are three primary types of cloud models:
Public Cloud
Private Cloud
Hybrid Cloud

1) Public Cloud
The Public Cloud is a cloud environment accessible over the internet, allowing anyone to create and manage resources. It is hosted and maintained by third-party providers and is available to the general public.

+ Key Features : Resources are shared among multiple users.
                 Accessible via the internet.
                 Cost-effective and highly scalable.
+ Example Use Case : A startup can use the public cloud to host its website or application without worrying about infrastructure management. Resources can be scaled up or down based on demand
+ Examples : AWS , GCP, Azure

2) Private Cloud
The Private Cloud is a cloud environment dedicated to a single organization. It provides enhanced security and control, making it ideal for businesses with strict compliance or regulatory requirements.

+ Key Features : Exclusive access to resources
                 Hosted on-premises or in a dedicated data center
                 Customizable to meet specific organizational needs
+ Example Use Case : A financial institution that handles sensitive customer data may opt for a private cloud to ensure data remains within its control and meets compliance standards.
+ Implementation : Private clouds can be set up using tools like OpenStack. For instance, an organization might create virtual machines (VMs) within its private network, accessible only to employees through a secure connection.

3) Hybrid Cloud
The Hybrid Cloud combines the features of both public and private clouds. It allows organizations to leverage the benefits of both models by seamlessly integrating their private cloud with a public cloud environment.

+ Key Features : Flexibility to run sensitive workloads on a private cloud while utilizing the public cloud for less critical tasks.
                 Enhanced scalability and cost-efficiency.
+ Example Use Case : A company may store customer data on a private cloud for security reasons while hosting its web application on a public cloud to handle unpredictable traffic spikes.
+ Implementation : Hybrid clouds can be implemented using services like AWS Outposts or Azure Arc, which enable smooth integration between public and private environments.

-- AWS GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE --
1) AWS Availability Zones : 120
2) AWS Geographic Regions : 38

- Minimum and Maximum AZs in a Region
Minimum AZs in a Region: 2
Maximum AZs in a Region: 6 
AWS guarantees at least two AZs in every Region for high availability.
+ Example
  ap-south-1 (Mumbai) → 3 AZs
  us-east-1 (N. Virginia) → 6 AZs

One or more Data Centers

-- AWS REGIONS --
A Region is a distinct geographical area where AWS operates its data centers. Each Region is independent to ensure better control and performance for users in that area.
Each Region provides localized services to minimize latency and meet compliance requirements.
All AWS Regions are connected to each other through AWS’s own private global network, not the public internet.
AWS has a high-speed, fiber-optic private backbone
with up to 100+ Gbps within Regions

- Why AWS Uses Global Regions?
AWS distributes its infrastructure across various Regions for several reasons:
1) Performance Optimization: Hosting data closer to users reduces latency.
Example: Indian customers accessing services in the Mumbai Region experience better speeds compared to using services hosted in the US.
2) Compliance: Some industries or governments require data to stay within specific countries or Regions.
Example: Government projects often mandate local data storage.
3) Disaster Recovery: Data redundancy across Regions minimizes risks from natural disasters or technical failures.
Example: Data stored in Mumbai can be backed up in another Region, such as Singapore.
4) Flexibility: Businesses can choose Regions based on their specific needs, such as cost-effectiveness or proximity.

-- AWS AVAILABILITY ZONES --
An Availability Zone is an isolated location within an AWS Region. 
Each AZ consists of one or more data centers that operate independently but are interconnected to other AZs within the same Region.

- Characteristics 
1) Isolation: Each AZ is designed to operate independently to minimize the risk of failure spreading across zones.
2) Redundancy: Multiple AZs ensure that if one zone experiences an issue, others can continue to function.
3) Interconnection: AZs within a Region are connected via high-speed, low-latency networks to facilitate efficient data replication and communication.

- Why Does AWS Use Availability Zones?
1) Disaster Recovery : AZs are designed to handle localized failures such as power outages or natural disasters.
Example: If a power failure affects one AZ in Mumbai, resources in other AZs in the same Region will remain operational.
2) High Availability: By distributing applications across multiple AZs, businesses can ensure minimal downtime.
                       Example: A web application hosted across three AZs will continue to serve users even if one AZ is temporarily unavailable.
3) Fault Tolerance: Each AZ is connected to independent power sources and networks, reducing the likelihood of a single point of failure.
4) Performance Optimization: High-speed connections between AZs enable efficient data synchronization and load balancing.

- How Are Availability Zones Structured?
Within an AWS Region, AZs are geographically separated but close enough to maintain low-latency connectivity. 
1) Distance Between AZs: Typically 60-100 kilometers (37-62 miles) apart to prevent simultaneous impact from disasters.
2) Independent Power Supply: Each AZ has its own power source and backup generators.
3) Independent Networking: AZs are connected to separate network grids, ensuring continued connectivity even if one network fails.

- Example: Mumbai Region
The Mumbai Region has multiple Availability Zones, strategically placed to ensure:
High availability for Indian users.
Compliance (data security) with data residency requirements.
Reliable disaster recovery options.

- Best Practices?
1) Deploy applications across multiple AZs within the Region to ensure redundancy and fault tolerance.
2) Use services like Elastic Load Balancing to distribute traffic across AZs.

- Benefits of Using Multiple Availability Zones?
1) Reduced Latency (decreasing the time delay it takes for data to travel from s->d): Low-latency connections (faster response time) between AZs ensure real-time data replication and high performance.
2) Improved Reliability: Applications distributed across AZs can handle failures without impacting end users.
3) Enhanced Security: Data transfers between AZs are encrypted, ensuring secure communication.
4) Compliance: AZs help meet regulatory requirements by offering localized data storage options.

-- LOCAL ZONES --
> helps improve the performance and availability of websites and applications for users all around the world.
> think of it as small data centers or points of presence strategically located in various cities and regions worldwide.
> These Edge locations are separate from AWS regions and are designed to bring content and services closer to end users.
> When you access a website or application hosted on AWS, your requests are usually directed to the nearest AWS Edge location. 
> These Edge locations act as a cache or temporary  storage for frequently accessed content, such as images, videos, and other static files.
> This means that instead of your requests traveling long distances to the main AWS servers in a region, the content can be delivered from the nearby Edge location, reducing the time it takes for the content to reach you.

- Main Benefits
1) Improved Performance : By caching content closer to users, AWS Edge locations reduce the latency or delay in delivering content. This results in faster loading times and a better user experience.
2) Enhanced Availability: If the main AWS servers in a region experience temporary issues or are temporarily unreachable, the content stored in Edge locations can still be served to users. This helps ensure that websites and applications remain accessible even during disruptions.
3) Global Content Delivery: With Edge locations spread across different cities and regions worldwide, AWS can efficiently deliver content to users in different geographic locations. This helps businesses reach and engage with their global audience effectively.

+  AWS Edge locations are like mini data centers strategically placed around the world to deliver content and services faster to users. 
+  They help improve performance, increase availability, and enable global content delivery for websites and applications hosted on AWS.
