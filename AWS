-- TRADITIONAL VS CLOUD COMPUTING --

- Understanding Traditional Infrastructure Challenges

Before the rise of cloud computing, businesses relied heavily on traditional infra to host their applications.
Setting up a simple website involved significant costs and complexities.

1) Server Purchase: You had to purchase a physical server costing around ₹50,000 or more.
                    The server needed a secure and cold environment, often requiring renting a dedicated space.

2) Maintenance Costs: Continuous power supply and cooling systems were essential.
                      You needed to hire IT professionals to manage the server, handle hardware failures (like hard disk or RAM issues), and perform regular maintenance.

3) Over or Underutilization: If you anticipated 10,000 users but only received 10, the investment in a high-capacity server was wasted.
                             Conversely, if the number of users exceeded expectations, the server would crash due to overload, resulting in downtime and a poor user experience.

4) Inflexibility: Scaling up or down based on demand was cumbersome, leading to either over-provisioning or under-provisioning.

Cloud Computing revolutionizes how infra is managed, offering a solution to all the challenges of traditional setups :


- Cloud Computing 
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics—over the internet (“the cloud”) on a pay-as-you-go basis, instead of owning and maintaining physical hardware.

1) On-Demand Resource Provisioning : With cloud computing, you pay only for the resources you use. Need a server for a day? No problem. The cloud provider charges you on an hourly or even per-second basis. This eliminates upfront costs and over-provisioning.

2) Scalability : Cloud services automatically scale based on your needs. For instance:
                 If your website receives 10 users today and 10 million tomorrow, the cloud can seamlessly add or reduce servers to handle the traffic.
                 During low-traffic periods, resources scale down, reducing costs.

3) No Maintenance Hassles : Cloud providers manage the physical infrastructure, so you don’t need to worry about hardware failures, power supply, or cooling systems. This allows you to focus entirely on developing and optimizing your application.

4) Global Accessibility : All your cloud resources are accessible over the internet, ensuring high availability and reliability for users worldwide.

- Everday Cloud Examples ?
1) Google Drive : Stores your files on the cloud
2) Gmail : Provides email services without needing to set up a personal mail server.
3) Netflix : Streams movies and shows via cloud-hosted platforms.

- Why Businesses Prefer Cloud Computing?
1) Cost Efficiency : You only pay for what you use. If you stop using a server, you can shut it down, and the billing stops immediately.
2) Scalability and Flexibility : Handle sudden spikes in traffic without any manual intervention or additional setup. Resources are allocated dynamically to match your application’s needs.
3) Focus on Core Goals :Since infrastructure management is handled by the cloud provider, businesses can focus on building robust applications and delivering excellent user experiences.


-- INTRODUCTION TO CLOUD SERVICES --
Cloud services have revolutionized how businesses manage and deploy their applications by offering flexibility, scalability, and cost efficiency.
three primary types of  cloud services: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service ( PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).

- What are Cloud Services?
Cloud services provide resources, tools, and services to businesses over the internet, eliminating the need for complex on-premises infrastructure. Understanding these services can help identify the right fit for your needs.

- Types of Cloud Services 

1) Infrastructure as s Service (IaaS)
IaaS provides businesses with essential IT infrastructure, including virtual machines, storage, and networking.

+ Key Features : The cloud provider offers hardware and virtualization, along with an operating system.
                 Users decide the type of operating system (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora) and are responsible for managing applications on top of it. 
+ Example Use Case : You’ve purchased a virtual server and chosen your preferred OS.
                     All software, configurations, and maintenance are your responsibility.
+ Examples : Amazon EC2
             Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines
             Google Compute Engine

2) Platform as a Service (PaaS)
PaaS provides a platform that allows developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

+ Key Features : The provider manages the OS, middleware, and runtime.
                 You focus solely on application development and data management.
+ Example Use Case : A database administrator leverages PaaS to create and configure a database platform, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, with built-in replication and security features.
                     Developers can directly interact with the database without managing hardware or OS configurations.
+ Examples : Amazon RDS
             Google App Engine
             Heroku

3) Software as a Service (SaaS)
SaaS delivers fully functional software applications over the internet. These applications are managed entirely by the service provider.

+ Key Features : No setup or maintenance is required on the user’s end.
                 The service provider handles infrastructure, application maintenance, and updates.
+ Example Use Case : Email services like Gmail or Microsoft Outlook allow businesses to create custom email addresses (e.g., tan@learning-ocean.com) without setting up mail servers.
+ Examples : Gmail
             Dropbox
             Salesforce

IaaS: Hardware and virtualization layers are provided, with users managing the OS and applications.
PaaS: Includes everything in IaaS, along with middleware and runtime. Users focus only on data and applications.
SaaS: All layers, from hardware to applications, are fully managed by the provider.

- How to Identify the Right Service for Your Needs?
When choosing a cloud service, consider the following:
1) What is this service managing on my behalf?
2) What responsibilities do I have?
3) Does it align with my project requirements?


-- TYPES OF CLOUD MODELS --
Cloud computing has transformed how businesses manage resources by offering flexible and scalable solutions. 
There are three primary types of cloud models:
Public Cloud
Private Cloud
Hybrid Cloud

1) Public Cloud
The Public Cloud is a cloud environment accessible over the internet, allowing anyone to create and manage resources. It is hosted and maintained by third-party providers and is available to the general public.

+ Key Features : Resources are shared among multiple users.
                 Accessible via the internet.
                 Cost-effective and highly scalable.
+ Example Use Case : A startup can use the public cloud to host its website or application without worrying about infrastructure management. Resources can be scaled up or down based on demand
+ Examples : AWS , GCP, Azure

2) Private Cloud
The Private Cloud is a cloud environment dedicated to a single organization. It provides enhanced security and control, making it ideal for businesses with strict compliance or regulatory requirements.

+ Key Features : Exclusive access to resources
                 Hosted on-premises or in a dedicated data center
                 Customizable to meet specific organizational needs
+ Example Use Case : A financial institution that handles sensitive customer data may opt for a private cloud to ensure data remains within its control and meets compliance standards.
+ Implementation : Private clouds can be set up using tools like OpenStack. For instance, an organization might create virtual machines (VMs) within its private network, accessible only to employees through a secure connection.

3) Hybrid Cloud
The Hybrid Cloud combines the features of both public and private clouds. It allows organizations to leverage the benefits of both models by seamlessly integrating their private cloud with a public cloud environment.

+ Key Features : Flexibility to run sensitive workloads on a private cloud while utilizing the public cloud for less critical tasks.
                 Enhanced scalability and cost-efficiency.
+ Example Use Case : A company may store customer data on a private cloud for security reasons while hosting its web application on a public cloud to handle unpredictable traffic spikes.
+ Implementation : Hybrid clouds can be implemented using services like AWS Outposts or Azure Arc, which enable smooth integration between public and private environments.
