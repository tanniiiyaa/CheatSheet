###Traditional Vs Cloud Computing

#### Understanding Traditional Infrastructure Challenges

Before the rise of cloud computing, businesses relied heavily on traditional infra to host their applications.
Setting up a simple website involved significant costs and complexities.
1) **Server Purchase:** You had to purchase a physical server costing around ₹50,000 or more.
The server needed a secure and cold environment, often requiring renting a dedicated space.
2) **Maintenance Costs:** Continuous power supply and cooling systems were essential.
You needed to hire IT professionals to manage the server, handle hardware failures (like hard disk or RAM issues), and perform regular maintenance.
3) **Over or Underutilization:** If you anticipated 10,000 users but only received 10, the investment in a high-capacity server was wasted.
Conversely, if the number of users exceeded expectations, the server would crash due to overload, resulting in downtime and a poor user experience.
4) **Inflexibility:** Scaling up or down based on demand was cumbersome, leading to either over-provisioning or under-provisioning.

Cloud Computing revolutionizes how infra is managed, offering a solution to all the challenges of traditional setups :
